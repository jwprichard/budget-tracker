## Architecture & Design Principles

### Architecture Pattern
- **Three-Tier Architecture**: Presentation (React SPA) → Business Logic (Express API) → Data (PostgreSQL)
- **Containerized Deployment**: Each tier runs in its own Docker container
- **Service Layer Pattern**: Business logic separated from controllers
- **Repository Pattern**: Data access abstraction through Prisma

### Design Principles
- **SOLID Principles**: Especially Single Responsibility and Dependency Inversion
- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Reusable components and utilities
- **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)**: Avoid over-engineering
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear boundaries between layers
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript across the entire stack

### Key Patterns
- **Repository Pattern**: Prisma provides database abstraction
- **Service Layer**: Business logic encapsulation
- **Middleware Pattern**: Express middlewares for cross-cutting concerns
- **Context API**: React state management
- **Server State Caching**: React Query for API data

### Code Organization
- **Frontend**: Component-based architecture with feature folders
- **Backend**: Controller → Service → Repository layering
- **Shared Types**: TypeScript interfaces shared between layers
- **User Isolation**: All queries filtered by userId for multi-tenant support

## Testing Strategy

**Current Project Approach:** Test After Implementation with Target Coverage

### Test Requirements
- **Backend**: Minimum 80% code coverage
  - Unit tests for service layer (Jest)
  - Integration tests for API endpoints (Supertest)
  - In-memory SQLite for fast testing
- **Frontend**: Minimum 70% code coverage
  - Unit tests for utilities and hooks (Vitest)
  - Component tests (React Testing Library)
  - E2E tests (Playwright - future enhancement)
- **Manual Testing**: Required for all user-facing features before merge
- **Edge Cases**: Must be identified and tested

### Testing Priorities
1. Business logic in service layer (critical)
2. API endpoint functionality (high)
3. Form validation and error handling (high)
4. UI components (medium)
5. Utility functions (medium)

## Development Workflow

### For Each Feature/Task

**This workflow is MANDATORY for all development work on this project.**

1. **Create Feature Branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/feature-name
   # or: git checkout -b bugfix/bug-name
   # or: git checkout -b refactor/refactor-name
   ```

2. **Create or Review Feature Plan**
   - Location: `/docs/feature-plans/`
   - Document should include:
     - Feature description and requirements
     - Implementation approach
     - Database schema changes (if applicable)
     - API endpoints (if applicable)
     - UI components (if applicable)
     - Acceptance criteria
     - Notes section for implementation progress

3. **Implement Feature Using Incremental Commits**

   **CRITICAL: Do NOT wait until the entire feature is complete to commit!**

   After completing each logical stage/step:

   **a. Update Documentation**
   - Update the feature plan with:
     - What was just completed
     - Any decisions made
     - Any deviations from original plan
     - Discoveries or learnings
     - Next steps
   - Keep a running history of progress

   **b. Commit Code + Documentation Together**
   - Each commit should include:
     - The code changes for that logical unit
     - Updated documentation reflecting those changes
   - Write clear, descriptive commit messages

   **c. Ensure Commit is Complete**
   - Code compiles/builds successfully (backend and frontend)
   - Tests pass (if tests exist)
   - No broken functionality
   - Represents a complete unit of work

   **Examples of Good Commit Points:**
   - After creating Prisma schema model
   - After implementing a service method with tests
   - After creating an API endpoint with validation
   - After implementing a React component
   - After adding a custom hook
   - After integrating frontend with backend API
   - After adding error handling to a feature
   - After completing a database migration

   **What Makes a Good Incremental Commit:**
   - ✅ Builds successfully (both backend and frontend if touched)
   - ✅ Tests pass (if tests exist)
   - ✅ Represents one logical change
   - ✅ Has descriptive commit message with type prefix
   - ✅ Includes updated documentation
   - ✅ Could be code reviewed independently
   - ✅ Doesn't break existing functionality

   **What is TOO SMALL for a commit:**
   - ❌ Changing a single variable name (unless it's a dedicated refactoring)
   - ❌ Adding a single import statement
   - ❌ Fixing a typo in a comment

   **What is TOO LARGE for a commit:**
   - ❌ "Implemented entire feature"
   - ❌ Multiple unrelated changes
   - ❌ Changes spanning frontend, backend, and database without logical grouping
   - ❌ More than 500 lines changed (usually a sign it should be broken up)

4. **Before Creating Pull Request**
   - Review all Quality Gates (see below)
   - Ensure feature plan is marked complete
   - Update ROADMAP.md checklist if applicable
   - Run final build and test suite
   - Check for any warnings or linting issues
   - Test manually in Docker containers

5. **Create Pull Request**
   - Title: Clear, descriptive summary with type prefix
   - Description: Link to feature plan, describe changes, note any special considerations
   - Include screenshots for UI changes
   - List any breaking changes
   - Request review from appropriate team members (if applicable)

6. **Address Review Feedback**
   - Make requested changes
   - Continue incremental commit pattern for review fixes
   - Update PR with responses to comments

7. **Merge After Approval**
   - Ensure all checks pass
   - Merge to main branch
   - Delete feature branch
   - Update project status in this claude.md file

## Working Principles

**How Claude Code Should Approach This Project:**

1. **Incremental Development**
   - Break work into small, testable units
   - Commit frequently with documentation updates
   - Each commit should represent a complete, working change
   - Never wait until a feature is "done" to commit
   - Backend and frontend can be committed separately or together depending on logical boundaries

2. **Documentation-Driven**
   - Update documentation with every commit
   - Document decisions and rationale
   - Keep feature plans up to date
   - Maintain this claude.md file
   - Update API documentation when endpoints change
   - Update Postman collection (`docs/Budget-Tracker-API.postman_collection.json`) when adding/modifying API endpoints

3. **Quality-Focused**
   - Follow quality gates before merging
   - Write clean, maintainable code
   - Consider edge cases and error scenarios
   - Test thoroughly (manual + automated)
   - Security-first mindset (authentication, authorization, input validation)

4. **Clear Communication**
   - Ask clarifying questions when requirements are ambiguous
   - Reference specific line numbers when discussing code
   - Explain technical decisions
   - Highlight potential issues or trade-offs
   - Document database schema changes clearly

5. **Architecture-Aware**
   - Follow three-tier architecture consistently
   - Respect separation of concerns (controller → service → repository)
   - Use Prisma for all database access (never raw SQL)
   - Ensure user-level data isolation (userId in all queries)
   - Consider maintainability and extensibility
   - Don't over-engineer for current requirements

6. **Context-Aware**
   - Read solution design document before implementing
   - Understand existing code patterns
   - Check for similar implementations elsewhere
   - Consider how changes affect the broader system
   - Review ROADMAP.md to understand current milestone

7. **Security-Conscious**
   - Always validate and sanitize user input (use Zod)
   - Use Prisma to prevent SQL injection
   - Hash passwords with bcrypt (12 rounds minimum)
   - Implement proper JWT token handling
   - Never expose sensitive data in API responses
   - Follow OWASP security best practices

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

**Common Mistakes That Cause Problems:**

1. **Large, Monolithic Commits**
   - ❌ Implementing backend and frontend for entire feature in one commit
   - ✅ Break into logical chunks (model → API → UI component)

2. **Implementation Without Understanding**
   - ❌ Writing code without reading the solution design
   - ✅ Review design document and existing patterns first

3. **Skipping Documentation**
   - ❌ "I'll document it later" (it never happens)
   - ✅ Update docs with each commit

4. **Incomplete Error Handling**
   - ❌ Happy path only implementations
   - ✅ Consider and handle error scenarios (validation errors, network failures, database errors)

5. **Ignoring Quality Gates**
   - ❌ "Tests can wait" or "I'll fix warnings later"
   - ✅ Meet quality standards before merging

6. **Over-Engineering**
   - ❌ Building elaborate abstractions for simple requirements
   - ✅ Solve the current problem appropriately (follow KISS principle)

7. **Copy-Paste Without Understanding**
   - ❌ Copying code snippets without understanding them
   - ✅ Understand what code does before using it

8. **Making Assumptions**
   - ❌ Guessing at requirements or architectural decisions
   - ✅ Ask clarifying questions

9. **Bypassing Prisma**
   - ❌ Writing raw SQL queries
   - ✅ Always use Prisma for database access

10. **Forgetting User Isolation**
    - ❌ Queries without userId filtering
    - ✅ Always filter by userId for user-specific data

11. **Hardcoding Configuration**
    - ❌ Hardcoded database URLs, API keys, etc.
    - ✅ Use environment variables

12. **Skipping Input Validation**
    - ❌ Trusting user input
    - ✅ Validate all inputs with Zod schemas

- **Next Phase**: Milestone 5 (Budget Management) OR Milestone 6 (Recurring Transactions)

### Recent Decisions (Updated Jan 16, 2026)
- Chose PostgreSQL over MySQL for better ACID compliance and JSON support
- Selected Material-UI over other UI libraries for comprehensive component set
- Using Prisma ORM for database abstraction and future flexibility
- Containerized deployment approach for easier self-hosting
- Multi-stage Dockerfiles for development and production targets
- Nginx Alpine for production frontend serving
- Winston for backend logging with file and console transports
- React Query for server state management
- Vite polling enabled for Docker/WSL hot reload compatibility
- **Added tslib as runtime dependency** - Required by TypeScript's `importHelpers` feature
- **Added OpenSSL to Alpine base image** - Prisma requires OpenSSL for database connections
- **Configured Prisma binary targets** - Set `linux-musl-openssl-3.0.x` for Alpine Linux compatibility
- **ARCHITECTURAL DECISION REVERSED: Multi-User Mode (Jan 13, 2026)** - Implemented full JWT authentication with user data isolation. All data models now include userId foreign keys. Authentication middleware protects all API endpoints. Frontend includes login/register flows with protected routes.
- **Balance Calculation Strategy (Jan 5, 2026)** - On-the-fly calculation using aggregate queries instead of stored balance field. Formula: `currentBalance = initialBalance + sum(transactions.amount)`
- **Transfer Pattern (Jan 5, 2026)** - Two-transaction pattern with `transferToAccountId` linking. Creates expense from source + income to destination in a single database transaction.
- **Amount Storage Convention (Jan 5, 2026)** - INCOME stored as positive, EXPENSE as negative, simplifies balance calculation
- **Date Validation (Jan 5, 2026)** - Only past/current dates allowed for now, future dates will be enabled in Milestone 6 for forecasting
- **Category Field Preparation (Jan 5, 2026)** - Added nullable `categoryId` to Transaction model for Milestone 3 compatibility
- **Material-UI Theme (Jan 5, 2026)** - Custom Indigo/Pink theme with Inter font, gradient backgrounds, enhanced shadows
- **CSV Import Implementation (Jan 6, 2026)** - Implemented early from Milestone 8 due to immediate user value

  - Frontend: Multi-step wizard (Upload → Map → Preview → Results)
  - Date format flexibility: 10 formats including 2-digit years (DD/MM/YY)
  - Duplicate detection: date + amount + description matching
  - Validation: Three-tier (file → field → duplicate)
- **Balance Adjustment Pattern (Jan 6, 2026)** - Edit account shows "Current Balance" instead of "Initial Balance"
  - Creates adjustment transaction for balance changes (maintains audit trail)
  - Never modifies historical data or initial balance
  - Transaction type: INCOME (increase) or EXPENSE (decrease)
- **Akahu Personal App Integration (Jan 6-12, 2026)** - Complete bank sync implementation
  - Provider abstraction layer (IBankingDataProvider) for future multi-provider support
  - AES-256-GCM encryption for secure token storage

  - Updates initialBalance: externalBalance - sum(transactions)
  - Ensures local balance matches bank balance
  - Non-critical operation (won't fail sync)
- **Date Calculation Fix (Jan 12, 2026)** - Proper millisecond conversion
  - Fixed: `new Date(lastSync).getTime() - 1 day`
  - First sync: 7 days back
  - Subsequent: 1 day before last sync
- **Rate Limiting Strategy (Jan 12, 2026)** - Exponential backoff retry logic
  - Retry delays: 1s, 2s, 4s for 429/500 errors
  - 500ms delay between pagination requests
  - 1-second delay between different accounts
- **Enhanced Akahu Data Display (Jan 13, 2026)** - Improved visibility of bank sync data

  - Color-coded transaction types (green=income, red=expense, blue=transfer)
  - Daily balance shown at bottom of each cell with color coding
  - Dialog view for full transaction details on date click
  - Dynamic month loading (fetches data only for displayed month)
  - Fixed timezone issue using local date values instead of UTC
  - Description truncation (20 characters max with ellipsis)
  - Fixed height cells (180px) with flex layout for consistent sizing
- **Calendar Navigation (Jan 14, 2026)** - Standalone page for calendar
  - Moved calendar from Analytics tabs to dedicated /calendar route
  - Added Calendar navigation link in AppBar with CalendarMonth icon
  - Simplified filters (account selection only, no date range needed)
  - Calendar manages its own date range based on month navigation
  - Analytics page now only has Categories and Trends tabs
- **Sync Transaction Debugging (Jan 14, 2026)** - View transactions fetched during sync
  - New endpoint: `GET /api/v1/sync/history/:syncHistoryId/transactions`
  - Clickable sync history rows open dialog with transaction list
  - Shows fetched transactions with status indicators (imported, duplicate, needs review)
  - Displays merchant names, account info, amounts, and dates

  - JWT tokens: 15-minute access tokens, 7-day refresh tokens
  - Password hashing with bcrypt (12 rounds minimum)
  - User data isolation: All queries filtered by userId at service layer
  - Authentication middleware on all protected API endpoints
  - Frontend: Login/register pages, protected routes, user menu with logout
  - Token management: Automatic refresh on 401 with request queuing
  - Critical fix: React Query cache clearing on login/logout prevents data leakage between users
  - User table mapping: Prisma model `User` → database table `users` (avoids SQL reserved keyword)
- **Smart Categorization & Rules Engine (Jan 16, 2026)** - Automatic transaction categorization
  - **Hierarchical Category Structure**: Store full Akahu category JSON in ExternalTransaction, parse on local transaction creation
  - **Auto-create Categories**: Bank sync automatically creates parent-child category relationships from Akahu data
  - **Priority-based Rule Evaluation**: User rules (highest priority) → Akahu mapping → Uncategorized (fallback)
  - **Text-based Rules**: Match on description, merchant, or notes fields with operators (contains, exact, startsWith, endsWith)
  - **Rule Conditions JSON**: Flexible JSON structure for conditions allows future extension (amount rules, composite rules, etc.)
  - **Batch Processing**: Bulk apply processes transactions in batches of 100 for performance
  - **Cache Management**: In-memory caching for rules and categories with invalidation on updates
  - **CategorySelect Component**: Reused existing TreeSelect component for hierarchical category selection in rule builder
  - **Match Statistics**: Track matchCount and lastMatched timestamp for each rule
  - **Database Models**: CategoryRule model with priority, isEnabled, isSystem fields for flexible rule management

## Project-Specific Notes

### Naming Conventions
- **Database**: snake_case for table and column names
- **TypeScript/JavaScript**: camelCase for variables and functions, PascalCase for classes and components
- **React Components**: PascalCase for component files (e.g., `TransactionList.tsx`)
- **API Endpoints**: kebab-case with plural nouns (e.g., `/api/v1/transactions`)
- **Environment Variables**: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., `DATABASE_URL`)

### Code Style
- **Indentation**: 2 spaces (both backend and frontend)
- **Quotes**: Single quotes for TypeScript/JavaScript
- **Semicolons**: Required
- **Line Length**: 100 characters maximum
- **Imports**: Organized (external → internal → relative)

### Integration Points
- **Frontend ↔ Backend**: RESTful API over HTTP (JSON)
- **Backend ↔ Database**: Prisma ORM (type-safe queries)
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens in Authorization header
- **Future**: Banking API integration (Plaid), Email service (future), SMS service (Twilio - future)

### Performance Requirements
- API response time < 200ms (p95)
- Frontend load time < 2s
- Database query time < 50ms (p95)
- Support for thousands of transactions per user

### Security Considerations
- All passwords hashed with bcrypt (12 rounds minimum)
- JWT tokens with short expiration (15 minutes access, 7 days refresh)
- Input validation on all endpoints (Zod)
- CORS restricted to frontend domain
- Rate limiting on authentication endpoints
- HTTPS required in production
- User-level data isolation (all queries filtered by userId)
- No sensitive data in logs

## Configuration & Settings

### Environment Variables

**Backend (.env)**:
```bash
# Database
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://budget_user:password@database:5432/budget_tracker

# JWT Secrets
JWT_SECRET=<strong-random-secret>
JWT_REFRESH_SECRET=<strong-random-secret>

# Node Environment
NODE_ENV=development  # or production

# API Configuration
PORT=3000
CORS_ORIGIN=http://localhost:5173
```

**Frontend (.env)**:
```bash
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3000/api/v1
```

### Secrets Management
- Development: `.env` files (not committed to git)
- Production: Environment variables in Docker Compose or container orchestration
- Never commit `.env` files (use `.env.example` as template)

### Build Configuration
- **Backend**: TypeScript compiled to `dist/` folder
- **Frontend**: Vite production build to `dist/` folder
- **Docker**: Multi-stage builds for smaller production images

## Common Commands

### Development (Local)

```bash
# Backend development
cd backend
npm install                 # Install dependencies
npm run dev                 # Start dev server with hot reload
npm run build               # Compile TypeScript
npm run test                # Run tests
npm run lint                # Run ESLint
npx prisma studio           # Open Prisma Studio (database GUI)
npx prisma migrate dev      # Create and apply migration
npx prisma db seed          # Seed database with default data

# Frontend development
cd frontend
npm install                 # Install dependencies
npm run dev                 # Start Vite dev server
npm run build               # Production build
npm run test                # Run tests
npm run lint                # Run ESLint
npm run preview             # Preview production build

# Database operations
cd backend
npx prisma migrate dev --name migration_name  # Create new migration
npx prisma migrate reset    # Reset database (WARNING: deletes all data)
npx prisma generate         # Generate Prisma client
npx prisma db push          # Push schema changes (dev only)
```

### Docker Operations

```bash
# Start all services
docker-compose up -d

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f              # All services
docker-compose logs -f api          # Backend only
docker-compose logs -f app          # Frontend only
docker-compose logs -f database     # Database only

# Stop all services
docker-compose down

# Rebuild and restart
docker-compose up -d --build

# Run database migrations in container
docker-compose exec api npx prisma migrate deploy

# Database backup
docker exec budget-tracker-db pg_dump -U budget_user budget_tracker > backup.sql

# Database restore
docker exec -i budget-tracker-db psql -U budget_user budget_tracker < backup.sql

# Access container shell
docker-compose exec api sh          # Backend container
docker-compose exec database sh     # Database container

# Remove all containers and volumes (DANGER)
docker-compose down -v
```

### Git Operations

```bash
# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/feature-name

# Check status
git status

# Stage and commit
git add .
git commit -m "[Type] Description"

# Push feature branch
git push -u origin feature/feature-name

# Update from main
git checkout main
git pull
git checkout feature/feature-name
git merge main

# Delete merged branch
git branch -d feature/feature-name
```

### Docker Troubleshooting

```bash
# Issue: "Cannot find module" errors (tslib, etc.)
# Solution: Clear Docker volumes and rebuild
docker compose down -v
docker compose build --no-cache
docker compose up -d

# Issue: Stale dependencies in containers
# Solution: Remove volumes to clear cached node_modules
docker compose down -v  # WARNING: Deletes database data too
docker compose up -d --build

# Issue: Prisma binary target mismatch
# Solution: Ensure schema.prisma has correct binaryTargets for Alpine Linux
# schema.prisma should include:
#   binaryTargets = ["native", "linux-musl-openssl-3.0.x"]
# Then rebuild containers

# Issue: OpenSSL errors with Prisma
# Solution: Ensure Dockerfile includes OpenSSL
# Dockerfile should have: RUN apk add --no-cache wget openssl

# View specific container logs
docker compose logs -f api
docker compose logs -f app --tail 100

# Check container resource usage
docker stats

# Access container shell for debugging
docker compose exec api sh
docker compose exec api ls -la node_modules/tslib  # Check if package exists
docker compose exec api npx prisma --version        # Check Prisma version

# Prune all unused Docker resources (careful!)
docker system prune -a --volumes  # Removes all stopped containers, unused images, volumes
```
